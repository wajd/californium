<h2>CloudCoAP-App</h2>

<p><em>May 14, 2019</em></p>
<h3>Intended Purpose of the CloudCoAP-App</h3>

<p>
    The CloudCoAP-App demonstrates the usage of CoAP in the internet.
    It contains implementations of
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347">DTLS 1.2 / RFC 6347</a>,
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252">CoAP / RFC 7252</a>,
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7959">CoAP Blockwise/ RFC 7959</a>, and
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id-05">DTLS 1.2
            Connection
            ID</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    Assuming to use a CoAP server for the communication, which supports also the
    "DTLS 1.2 Connection ID", it demonstrates connection less encryption.
    The device may even change from cellular communication to WiFi
    without losing the encryption context. That results in less DTLS handshakes.
</p>
<p>
    The App may be used with your own CoAP server implementation and may be adapted
    to your needs. Check the
    <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/californium">Eclipse Californium Project</a>.
    for more information.
</p>

<h3>Usage of personalized data</h3>
<p>
    The app doesn't use personalized data.
</p>
<h3>Usage of personalizable data</h3>
<p>
    The App uses IP/UDP and requires therefore an ip-address and port.
    Depending on your ISP, that may be used to identify you. The other
    IDs mention below may be used to related the messages with previous
    ip-addresses and ports.
</p>
<p>
    If the App uses (D)TLS encryption, a session ID and a connection ID is used to
    identify the encryption context. To change these IDs, use the "Reset All"
    function in the menu. That will trigger a new handshake and assign new IDs to
    the new encryption context. The encryption is also based on long term credentials,
    e.g. x.509 certificates. These credentials can not be changed without rebuilding this
    App.
</p>
<p>
    If the "Request Statistic" mode is used, a random UUID is used as device ID to
    related the requests from your device to create the communication statistic.
    To change that device ID use the "Reset Device ID" or "Reset All" function
    in the menu. The request itself send that device ID and the timestamp of the
    request. It receives as response the timestamps of up to the last 8 requests
    received with that device ID.
